                <p>Hi My Love~~! Welcome to the best website in the world, made specially for you. Thank you so much for the last two years. Two years packed full of special memories and happiness. Thank you for making me feel special and being by my side. As always, you shine as bright as ever, and every moment I spend with you makes me shine brighter as well. That is the kind of influence you have on the people around you, my love. What a wonderful time the last two years has been. I have grown so much as a person, and so much of that growth comes from you. Loving you makes me love myself better, and I cannot ever thank you enough for that. Every conversation, every joke, every interaction I have with you is full of joy. I never thought that I would meet someone that I could enjoy so much of my time with. No matter how introverted and tired of people I get, I seem to never get sick of you. I could spend hours, days, and weeks with you, and every moment will be refreshing and joyful. What a person you are. My pretty, cute, lovely, beautiful, cool, handsome, and squishy boyfriend!!! I am so excited for what the future holds for us. How our relationship will evolve. How we will grow as individuals. I am so excited for all the new memories we will make, my love. Thank you for the last two years. To many more!! I love you!</p>
                <p>Love, 채원이</p>
